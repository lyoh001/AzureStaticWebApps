                <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
                <p>Information obtained from the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority revealed that coffee berry disease
                    (CBD), CWD, and coffee leaf rust (CLR) are the three major fungal diseases of Arabica coffee, which
                    are causing a significant reduction in coffee production and consumption in the country. These
                    diseases can cause severe damage to the coffee plants, leading to reduced yields and a decline in
                    the quality of the coffee beans.

                    The traditional approach employed for illness surveillance is observation with the naked eye, which
                    is time-consuming, expensive, and requires significant competence. This approach is also prone to
                    human error, leading to inaccurate identification and treatment of the diseases. Therefore, it is
                    important to find an alternative solution that can automatically identify the diseases without the
                    need for experts.

                    One potential solution is the use of deep learning, object detection, and image classification to
                    solve this problem. These technologies have been widely used in various fields such as medical
                    imaging, self-driving cars, and facial recognition, and have shown great potential in the
                    identification and management of plant diseases.

                    Deep learning methods have been introduced for the detection of different types of coffee plant
                    diseases caused by pests and pathogens. These diseases can be classified by machine learning
                    techniques like segmentation, and classification along with the estimation of the severity of
                    stress. By using deep learning algorithms, the system can identify patterns and features in the
                    images of the infected plants that are not visible to the human eye.

                    Additionally, object detection can be used to identify specific regions of the coffee plant that are
                    affected by the disease, allowing for targeted treatment. This can help farmers to apply the right
                    type and amount of treatment to the affected areas, reducing the use of chemicals and increasing the
                    efficiency of the treatment. Image classification can also be used to accurately identify the type
                    of disease present on the plant, such as CBD, CWD, or CLR. This can help farmers to choose the most
                    appropriate treatment for the specific disease, increasing the chances of successful treatment.

                    Furthermore, using deep learning models can also help in predicting the potential spread of the
                    disease, helping farmers to take preventative measures and avoiding widespread crop damage. This can
                    include early detection and treatment of the disease, as well as identifying and isolating infected
                    plants to prevent the spread of the disease to healthy plants.

                    The use of such technology can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with manual disease
                    identification, as well as increasing the accuracy and efficiency of disease identification and
                    management. By leveraging the power of deep learning, object detection, and image classification,
                    farmers can better protect their crops and increase their yields, leading to a more sustainable and
                    profitable coffee industry in Ethiopia.
