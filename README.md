#  Azure Static Web Apps

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

Welcome to the Azure Functions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive machine learning reference notebook and workflow that can be used by data scientists. The repository includes the following key components:

- **Notebooks**: A collection of notebooks that guide you through the process of building machine learning models.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A robust continuous integration and deployment pipeline for deploying web applications to Azure.
- **GitHub Codespace**: A streamlined development environment powered by GitHub Codespaces.

## 2. Logical Architecture

### 2.1 Logical System Component Overview

The logical architecture of this system is designed to facilitate the end-to-end machine learning model deployment process. Here's an overview of the components and their interactions:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Data is extracted from SQL databases and transferred to AWS SageMaker Studio lab for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building.
2. **Model Development**: ML and DL models are built using advanced techniques and exported for later consumption as a machine learning/deep learning service via API.
3. **Version Control and Collaboration**: Notebooks, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates, and ML models are stored and version-controlled in this GitHub repository, enabling collaboration and reproducibility.
4. **Automated Build Process**: Leveraging GitHub Actions, the repository is set up with an automated build pipeline that constructs an Azure Static Web App and Azure Function using Bicep, ensuring efficient and consistent deployments.
5. **API Invocation**: The machine learning model is exposed as an API through the Azure Function, enabling seamless integration with other systems and applications.
6. **Keep Function Warm**: Logic Apps are configured to trigger the function every 2 minutes, ensuring that the function remains warm and preventing cold starts for optimal performance.
7. **Web App Consumption**: End users can access the machine learning model as a service through the provided web app, enabling them to make predictions based on the trained models.

## 3. Power BI Dashboard for Visualization
